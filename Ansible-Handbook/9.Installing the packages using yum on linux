-   ansible server-name:group1:group2 -m yum -a "name=git state=present" -b  // To install the git package/or any other package files on machine(As the root user -b)
-   ansible server-name:group1:group2 -m yum -a "name=git state=absent" -b  // To unistall the git package from machine

**ANSIBLE FACTS
> Ansible facts are nothing but information about managed noedes like: OS distribution,release,processor,python etc.......
> The task of collecting this remote system information is called as Gathering Facts, and collected/Gathered information is called facts or variable.
> You can Gather/Collect Facts using 'setup' module in Ad-hoc commands.
> Note:- Ansible Playbooks call this setup module by default to perform Gathering Facts task. 
 
-  ansible group-name -m setup                            // Using the 'setup' modules
-  ansible group-name -m setup "filter=ansible_mounts"    //Information just regarding the ansible_mounts
-  ansible group-name -m setup "filter=ansible_architecture"

> The output of setup module is a combination of dict,list and text values.

> There are 2 Ansible Facts or Variables for the managed nodes
  They are 1) Default Facts
           2) Custom Facts

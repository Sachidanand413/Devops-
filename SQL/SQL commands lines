- SELECT * FROM <table-name>;   //SELECT * FROM Customers; 

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID,
CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to 
maintain specific information about every record in the table.
	A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records 
in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.
	A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.

A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). 
Tables contain records (rows) with data.
Keep in Mind That...
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.
Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement 
to be executed in the same call to the server.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database
- INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
- CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
- ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
- CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
- ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
- DROP TABLE - deletes a table
- CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
- DROP INDEX - deletes an index

The SQL SELECT Statement -

- SELECT column1, column2, ...
- FROM table_name;

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the
fields available in the table, use the following syntax:
- SELECT * FROM table_name;

SELECT Column Example
The following SQL statement selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the "Customers" table:

Example
- SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
*********************************************************************************
	The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

SELECT DISTINCT Syntax - 
- SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
- FROM table_name;

SELECT Example Without DISTINCT
The following SQL statement selects ALL (including the duplicates) values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

Example
- SELECT Country FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

Example
- SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:
Example
- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
Here is the workaround for MS Access:
Example
- SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
- FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
*********************************************************************************************

The SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
WHERE Syntax

- SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;

The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:
Example
- SELECT * FROM Customers
  WHERE Country='Mexico';
Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).
However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:
Example
- SELECT * FROM Customers
  WHERE CustomerID=1;
  
Operators in The WHERE Clause
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

Operator	Description	Example
- 	=	Equal	
- 	>	Greater than	
- 	<	Less than	
- 	>=	Greater than or equal	
- 	<=	Less than or equal	
- 	<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
- 	BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
- 	LIKE	Search for a pattern	
- 	IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column	
*************************************************************************************************
	The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition (s) is NOT TRUE.

AND Syntax
-	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
	
OR Syntax
-	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
	
NOT Syntax
-	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE NOT condition;
	AND Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city is "Berlin":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';
	OR Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where city is "Berlin" OR "München":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" OR "Spain":
Example
- 	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany' OR Country='Spain';
NOT Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE NOT Country='Germany';

Combining AND, OR and NOT
You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators.
The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "München" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';
**************************************************************************************************************
The SQL ORDER BY Keyword

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC
keyword.
ORDER BY Syntax
-	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
	
ORDER BY Example
	The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" column:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	ORDER BY Country;

ORDER BY DESC Example
	The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted DESCENDING by the "Country" column:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	ORDER BY Country DESC;
	
ORDER BY Several Columns Example
	The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" 
	column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
	
ORDER BY Several Columns Example 2
	The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and 
	descending by the "CustomerName" column:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
**************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

INSERT INTO Syntax
It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways.

The first way specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:
-	INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. The INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:
-	INSERT INTO table_name
	VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);	

INSERT INTO Example
The following SQL statement inserts a new record in the "Customers" table:
Example
-	INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
	VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
Insert Data Only in Specified Columns
It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.

The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):
Example
-	INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
	VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
**************************************************************************************************************
What is a NULL Value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to
this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.
Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one 
that has been left blank during record creation!
How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.
IS NULL Syntax
-	SELECT column_names
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax
-	SELECT column_names
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The IS NULL Operator
The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).
The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:
Example
-	SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
	FROM Customers
	WHERE Address IS NULL;

The IS NOT NULL Operator
The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).
The following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:
Example
-	SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
	FROM Customers
	WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;
************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax
-	UPDATE table_name
	SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
	WHERE condition;
Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause
specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!
UPDATE Table
The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.

Example
-	UPDATE Customers
	SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
	WHERE CustomerID = 1;

UPDATE Multiple Records
It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.
The following SQL statement will update the contactname to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":
Example
-	UPDATE Customers
	SET ContactName='Juan'
	WHERE Country='Mexico';

Update Warning!
Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!
Example
-	UPDATE Customers
	SET ContactName='Juan';
**************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE Syntax
-	DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause 
specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

SQL DELETE Example
The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:
Example
-	DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
Delete All Records
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, 
and indexes will be intact:
-	DELETE FROM table_name;
The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:
Example
-	DELETE FROM Customers;
**************************************************************************************************************************
SQL TOP, LIMIT or ROWNUM Clause
The SQL SELECT TOP Clause
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact 
performance.
Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number
of records, while Oracle uses ROWNUM.
SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
-	SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
MySQL Syntax:
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	LIMIT number;
Oracle Syntax:
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

SQL TOP, LIMIT and ROWNUM Examples
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
Example
-	SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example using the LIMIT clause (for MySQL):
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	LIMIT 3;

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example using ROWNUM (for Oracle):
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;

SQL TOP PERCENT Example
The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
Example
-	SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" 
(for SQL Server/MS Access):
Example
-	SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany';

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example using the LIMIT clause (for MySQL):
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany'
	LIMIT 3;

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example using ROWNUM (for Oracle):
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany' AND ROWNUM <= 3;
**************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.

MIN() Syntax
-	SELECT MIN(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
MAX() Syntax
-	SELECT MAX(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;

MIN() Example
The following SQL statement finds the price of the cheapest product:
Example
-	SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
	FROM Products;

MAX() Example
The following SQL statement finds the most expensive product from the table:
Example
-	SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice
	From Products;
****************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column.
COUNT() Syntax
-	SELECT COUNT(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
AVG() Syntax
-	SELECT AVG(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
SUM() Syntax
-	SELECT SUM(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
COUNT() Example
The following SQL statement finds the number of products:
Example
-	SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
	FROM Products;
Note: NULL values are not counted.
AVG() Example
The following SQL statement finds the average price of all products:
Example
-	SELECT AVG(Price)
	FROM Products;
Note: NULL values are ignored.
SUM() Example
The following SQL statement finds the sum of the "Quantity" fields in the "OrderDetails" table:
Example
-	SELECT SUM(Quantity)
	FROM OrderDetails;
Note: NULL values are ignored.
*************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ - The underscore represents a single character
Note: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).

The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

LIKE Syntax
-	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.
Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:
LIKE Operator	Description
-	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position	
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
	WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"
SQL LIKE Examples
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName starting with "a":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName ending with "a":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "or" in any position:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "r" in the second position:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters 
in length:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a ContactName that starts with "a" and ends with "o":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that does NOT start with "a":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';
******************************************************************************************************************************
SQL Wildcard Characters
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the SQL LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

Wildcard Characters in MS Access
Symbol	Description	Example
-	 *	Represents zero or more characters	bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob
-	?	Represents a single character	h?t finds hot, hat, and hit
-	[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
-	!	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	-	Represents a range of characters	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
-	#	Represents any single numeric character	2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295

Wildcard Characters in SQL Server
Symbol	Description	Example
-	%	Represents zero or more characters	bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
-	_	Represents a single character	h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
-	[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
-	^	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	-	Represents a range of characters	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
All the wildcards can also be used in combinations!
Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:
LIKE Operator	Description
-	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that starts with "a"
-	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that ends with "a"
-	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
-	WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
-	WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
-	WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City containing the pattern "es": 
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE '%es%';
Using the _ Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "ondon":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", 
followed by any character, followed by "on":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';
Using the [!charlist] Wildcard
The two following SQL statements select all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';
Or:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
**************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
IN Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
or:
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
IN Operator Examples
The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":

Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
The following SQL statement selects all customers that are NOT located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
The following SQL statement selects all customers that are from the same countries as the suppliers:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
***************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL BETWEEN Operator
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

BETWEEN Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
BETWEEN Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
NOT BETWEEN Example
To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
BETWEEN with IN Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20	
	AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);
BETWEEN Text Values Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
	ORDER BY ProductName;
The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE ProductName BETWEEN "Carnarvon Tigers" AND "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning"
	ORDER BY ProductName;
NOT BETWEEN Text Values Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName NOT BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
	ORDER BY ProductName;
NOT BETWEEN Text Values Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName NOT BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
	ORDER BY ProductName;
BETWEEN Dates Example
The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate BETWEEN '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996':
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Orders
	WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #01/07/1996# AND #31/07/1996#;
OR:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Orders
	WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
***************************************************************************************************************************
SQL Aliases
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of the query.
Alias Column Syntax
-	SELECT column_name AS alias_name
	FROM table_name;
Alias Table Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name AS alias_name;
The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. 
Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:
Example
-	SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
	FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
Example
-	SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
	FROM Customers;
Note: To get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:
-	SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address
	FROM Customers;
Alias for Tables Example
The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the
"Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to 
make the SQL shorter):
Example
-	SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
	FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
	WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:
Example
-	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
	FROM Customers, Orders
	WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
Aliases can be useful when:
There are more than one table involved in a query
Functions are used in the query
Column names are big or not very readable
Two or more columns are combined together
*****************************************************************************************************************************
SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:

OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
10308	2	1996-09-18
10309	37	1996-09-19
10310	77	1996-09-20
Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Country
1	Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Mexico
3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Antonio Moreno	Mexico
Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:

Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
and it will produce something like this:

OrderID	CustomerName	OrderDate
10308	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	9/18/1996
10365	Antonio Moreno Taquería	11/27/1996
10383	Around the Horn	12/16/1996
10355	Around the Horn	11/15/1996
10278	Berglunds snabbköp	8/12/1996
Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
SQL INNER JOIN  SQL LEFT JOIN  SQL RIGHT JOIN  SQL FULL OUTER JOIN

SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
INNER JOIN Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1
	INNER JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
SQL INNER JOIN Example
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer information:
Example
-	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
	FROM Orders
	INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

 JOIN Three Tables
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:
Example
-	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
	FROM ((Orders
	INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
	INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
++++++++++++++++++++
SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.
LEFT JOIN Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1
	LEFT JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
Note: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.
SQL LEFT JOIN Example
The following SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have:
Example
-	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	FROM Customers
	LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
	ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right
table (Orders).
SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table 
(table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.
RIGHT JOIN Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1
	RIGHT JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
Note: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
SQL RIGHT JOIN
Demo Database
In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.
Below is a selection from the "Orders" table:
OrderID	CustomerID	EmployeeID	OrderDate	ShipperID
10308	2	7	1996-09-18	3
10309	37	3	1996-09-19	1
10310	77	8	1996-09-20	2
And a selection from the "Employees" table:
EmployeeID	LastName	FirstName	BirthDate	Photo
1	Davolio	Nancy	12/8/1968	EmpID1.pic
2	Fuller	Andrew	2/19/1952	EmpID2.pic
3	Leverling	Janet	8/30/1963	EmpID3.pic
SQL RIGHT JOIN Example
The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:
Example
-	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
	FROM Orders
	RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
	ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees),
even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).
Number of Records: 197

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!
Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.
FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1	
	FULL OUTER JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
	WHERE condition;
SQL FULL OUTER JOIN
Demo Database
In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.
Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:
CustomerID	CustomerName	 ContactName	Address	City	PostalCode	Country
1   Alfreds Futterkiste	     Maria Anders	Obere Str. 57	Berlin	12209	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados

3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	 Antonio Moreno	Mataderos 2312	México D.F.	05023	Mexico
And a selection from the "Orders" table:

OrderID	CustomerID	EmployeeID	OrderDate	ShipperID
10308	    2	        7	     1996-09-18	   3
10309	    37      	3      	 1996-09-19	   1
10310	    77       	8	     1996-09-20	   2

SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Example
The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:
-	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	FROM Customers
	FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
	ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
A selection from the result set may look like this:

CustomerName						OrderID
Alfreds Futterkiste					Null
Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	10308
Antonio Moreno Taquería				10365
Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, 
if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have 
matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.
++++++++++++++++++++++
SQL Self JOIN
A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

Self JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.

Demo Database
In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Address	City	PostalCode	Country

3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Antonio Moreno	Mataderos 2312	México D.F.	05023	Mexico
SQL Self JOIN Example
The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:
Example
-	SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
	FROM Customers A, Customers B
	WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
	AND A.City = B.City
	ORDER BY A.City;
*************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL UNION Operator
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order
UNION Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
	UNION
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:
-	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
	UNION ALL
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement in the UNION.
Demo Database
In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.
Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:
CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Address	City	PostalCode	Country

1	Exotic Liquid	Charlotte Cooper	49 Gilbert St.	London	EC1 4SD	UK
2	New Orleans Cajun Delights	Shelley Burke	P.O. Box 78934	New Orleans	70117	USA
3	Grandma Kelly's Homestead	Regina Murphy	707 Oxford Rd.	Ann Arbor	48104	USA
SQL UNION Example
The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
Example
-	SELECT City FROM Customers
	UNION
	SELECT City FROM Suppliers
	ORDER BY City;
Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!
SQL UNION ALL Example
The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
Example
-	SELECT City FROM Customers
	UNION ALL
	SELECT City FROM Suppliers
	ORDER BY City;
SQL UNION With WHERE
The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
Example
-	SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany'
	UNION
	SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
	WHERE Country='Germany'
	ORDER BY City;
SQL UNION ALL With WHERE
The following SQL statement returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
Example
-	SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
	WHERE Country='Germany'
	UNION ALL
	SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
	WHERE Country='Germany'
	ORDER BY City;
Another UNION Example
The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:
Example
-	SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
	FROM Customers
	UNION
	SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
	FROM Suppliers;
Notice the "AS Type" above - it is an alias. SQL Aliases are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. An alias 
only exists for the duration of the query. So, here we have created a temporary column named "Type", that list whether 
the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier".
Result:
Number of Records: 120
Type	ContactName	City	Country
Customer	Alejandra Camino	Madrid	Spain
Customer	Alexander Feuer	Leipzig	Germany
Customer	Ana Trujillo	México D.F.	Mexico

**************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL GROUP BY Statement
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
GROUP BY Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s)
	ORDER BY column_name(s);
SQL GROUP BY Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:
Example
-	SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
	FROM Customers
	GROUP BY Country;
Number of Records: 21
COUNT(CustomerID)	Country
		3			Argentina
		2			Austria
		2			Belgium
		9			Brazil
		3			Canada
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:
Example
-	SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
	FROM Customers
	GROUP BY Country
	ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
Result:
Number of Records: 21
COUNT(CustomerID)	Country
		13			USA
		11			Germany
		11			France
		9			Brazil
		7			UK
		5			Spain
		.
SQL Statement:
-	SELECT Shippers.ShipperName,COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
	LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
	GROUP BY ShipperName;
Result:
Number of Records: 3
ShipperName		NumberOfOrders
Federal Shipping	68
Speedy Express		54
United Package		74
***************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.
HAVING Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s)
	HAVING condition
	ORDER BY column_name(s);
SQL HAVING Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers:
Example
-	SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
	FROM Customers
	GROUP BY Country
	HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
Result:
Number of Records: 5
COUNT(CustomerID)	Country
	9	Brazil
	11	France
	11	Germany
	7	UK
	13	USA
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low (Only include countries with
more than 5 customers):
Example
-	SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
	FROM Customers
	GROUP BY Country
	HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
	ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
Result:
Number of Records: 5
COUNT(CustomerID)	Country
	13	USA
	11	Germany
	11	France
	9	Brazil
	7	UK
More HAVING Examples
The following SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders:
Example
-	SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
	FROM (Orders
	INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
	GROUP BY LastName
	HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
Result:
Number of Records: 8
LastName	NumberOfOrders
	Buchanan	11
	Callahan	27
	Davolio	29
	Fuller	20
	King	14
	Leverling	31
	Peacock	40
Suyama	18
The following SQL statement lists if the employees "Davolio" or "Fuller" have registered more than 25 orders:
Example
-	SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
	FROM Orders
	INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
	WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
Result:
Number of Records: 1
LastName	NumberOfOrders
Davolio	29
****************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL EXISTS Operator
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.
EXISTS Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE EXISTS
	(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
SQL EXISTS Examples
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20:
Example
-	SELECT SupplierName
	FROM Suppliers
	WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price equal to 22:
Example
-	SELECT SupplierName
	FROM Suppliers
	WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price = 22);
****************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL ANY and ALL Operators
The ANY and ALL operators are used with a WHERE or HAVING clause.
The ANY operator returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition.
The ALL operator returns true if all of the subquery values meet the condition.
ANY Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name operator ANY
	(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
ALL Syntax
-	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name operator ALL
	(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
SQL ANY Examples
The ANY operator returns TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition.
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table that 
quantity = 10:
Example
-	SELECT ProductName
	FROM Products
	WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
Number of Records: 31
	ProductName
	Chais 
	Chang 
	Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning 
	Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears 
	Konbu 
	Tofu 
	Pavlova 
Teatime Chocolate Biscuits 
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table that
quantity > 99:
Example
-	SELECT ProductName
	FROM Products
	WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity > 99);
Number of Records: 2
	ProductName
	Steeleye Stout 
	Pâté chinois 
SQL ALL Example
The ALL operator returns TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition.
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has
quantity = 10 (so, this example will return FALSE, because not ALL records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10):
Example
-	SELECT ProductName
	FROM Products
	WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
Number of Records: 0
ProductName
*****************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL SELECT INTO Statement
The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.
SELECT INTO Syntax
Copy all columns into a new table:
-	SELECT *
	INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
	FROM oldtable
	WHERE condition;
Copy only some columns into a new table:
-	SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
	INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
	FROM oldtable
	WHERE condition;
The new table will be created with the column-names and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names
using the AS clause.
SQL SELECT INTO Examples
The following SQL statement creates a backup copy of Customers:
-	SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017
	FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement uses the IN clause to copy the table into a new table in another database:
-	SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'
	FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement copies only a few columns into a new table:
-	SELECT CustomerName, ContactName INTO CustomersBackup2017
	FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement copies only the German customers into a new table:
-	SELECT * INTO CustomersGermany
	FROM Customers
	WHERE Country = 'Germany';
The following SQL statement copies data from more than one table into a new table:
-	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	INTO CustomersOrderBackup2017
	FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
Tip: SELECT INTO can also be used to create a new, empty table using the schema of another. Just add a WHERE clause that 
causes the query to return no data:
-	SELECT * INTO newtable
	FROM oldtable
	WHERE 1 = 0;
***************************************************************************************************************************
The SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Statement
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
INSERT INTO SELECT requires that data types in source and target tables match
The existing records in the target table are unaffected
INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax
Copy all columns from one table to another table:
-	INSERT INTO table2
	SELECT * FROM table1
	WHERE condition;
Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
-	INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
	FROM table1
	WHERE condition;
SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Examples
The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain 
NULL):
Example
-	INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
	SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):
Example
-	INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
	SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country FROM Suppliers;
The following SQL statement copies only the German suppliers into "Customers":
Example
-	INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
	SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
	WHERE Country='Germany';
**************************************************************************************************************************	
The SQL CASE Statement
The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE 
statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns 
the value in the ELSE clause.
If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.
CASE Syntax
-	CASE
		WHEN condition1 THEN result1
		WHEN condition2 THEN result2
		WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
		ELSE result
	END;
SQL CASE Examples
The following SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:
Example
-	SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
	CASE
		WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
		WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
		ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
	END AS QuantityText
	FROM OrderDetails;
The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:
Example
-	SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
	FROM Customers
	ORDER BY
	(CASE
		WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
		ELSE City
	END);
**************************************************************************************************************************
SQL IFNULL(), ISNULL(), COALESCE(), and NVL() Functions
Look at the following "Products" table:

P_Id	ProductName	UnitPrice	UnitsInStock	UnitsOnOrder
1	Jarlsberg	10.45	16	15
2	Mascarpone	32.56	23	 
3	Gorgonzola	15.67	9	20
Suppose that the "UnitsOnOrder" column is optional, and may contain NULL values.

Look at the following SELECT statement:
-	SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder)
	FROM Products;
In the example above, if any of the "UnitsOnOrder" values are NULL, the result will be NULL.
Solutions
MySQL
The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:
-	SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
	FROM Products;
or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
-	SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
	FROM Products;
SQL Server
The SQL Server ISNULL() function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL:
-	SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
	FROM Products;
MS Access
The MS Access IsNull() function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0):
-	SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IIF(IsNull(UnitsOnOrder), 0, UnitsOnOrder))
	FROM Products;
Oracle
The Oracle NVL() function achieves the same result:
-	SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + NVL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
	FROM Products;
****************************************************************************************************************************
What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to
execute it.
You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) 
that is passed.
Stored Procedure Syntax
-	CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
	AS
	sql_statement
	GO;
Execute a Stored Procedure
-	EXEC procedure_name;
Stored Procedure Example
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure named "SelectAllCustomers" that selects all records from the "Customers" table:
Example
-	CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
	AS
	SELECT * FROM Customers
	GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
Example
-	EXEC SelectAllCustomers;
Stored Procedure With One Parameter
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:
Example
-	CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
	AS
	SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
	GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
Example
-	EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';
Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters
Setting up multiple parameters is very easy. Just list each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:
Example
-	CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
	AS
	SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
	GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
Example
-	EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';
***************************************************************************************************************************
SQL Comments
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.
Note: The examples in this chapter will not work in Firefox and Microsoft Edge!
Comments are not supported in Microsoft Access databases. Firefox and Microsoft Edge are using Microsoft Access database 
in our examples.
Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with --.
Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:
Example
-	--Select all:
	SELECT * FROM Customers;
The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore the end of a line:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';
The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore a statement:
Example
-	--SELECT * FROM Customers;
	SELECT * FROM Products;
Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.
The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:
Example
-	/*Select all the columns
	of all the records
	in the Customers table:*/
	SELECT * FROM Customers;
The following example uses a multi-line comment to ignore many statements:
Example
-	/*SELECT * FROM Customers;
	SELECT * FROM Products;
	SELECT * FROM Orders;
	SELECT * FROM Categories;*/
	SELECT * FROM Suppliers;
To ignore just a part of a statement, also use the /* */ comment.
The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a line:
Example
-	SELECT CustomerName, /*City,*/ Country FROM Customers;
The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a statement:
Example
-	SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE (CustomerName LIKE 'L%'
	OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%' /*OR CustomerName LIKE 'S%'
	OR CustomerName LIKE 'T%'*/ OR CustomerName LIKE 'W%')
	AND Country='USA'
	ORDER BY CustomerName;
